Farm Management is a Julia program that helps farmers calculate their expenses.

In short, this is a basic Farm Management application that displays total cost expenses and profits. 
This program lets the user test a variety of rates from milk stats, to employee info. 
Real numerical values are incorporated into this program to give the most accurate outcome possible.
