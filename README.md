Farm Management is a Julia program that helps farmers calculate their expenses.

In short, this is a basic Farm Management application that displays total cost expenses and profits. 
This program lets the user test a variety of rates from milk stats, to employee info. 
Real numerical values are incorporated into this program to give the most accurate outcome possible.

This program works on replit. Other IDEs have never been tested with this program.
